# IOT (Internet of Things)

Internet of things is an interrelated network of computing devices, electronics, sensors, actuators, connectors and objects each provided with unique identifiers (UIDs) and with the ability to connect, interact and exchange data expanding its scope with the pace in the technologies.


IoT is nothing more than a computer attached to the Things. As no computer is completely secured, neither any of the smart and virtual technologies can be secured. Thus, these objects form a massive distributed network with billions of entry points to be hacked. Due to lack of security in many cheap products it is relatively easy to be hacked. Even the devices with advanced security can be hacked, such as driverless cars are vulnerable, thus IoT technologies leads to some major security problems.

# Effects of Vulnerability

Pacemakers getting hacked, air traffic control systems going down, and all out “cyber war” are just some of the worst- case scenarios. The exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to damage, injury and death. 

# Case Study
In 2015, the Ukrainian power grid was affected by a cyber-attack that left Kiev without electricity for several hours. In the same year, Sweden government leaks the personal details of nearly all the citizens. This was a massive data breach in the Swedish Transport Agency (Transportstyrelsen) after the agency mishandled an outsourcing deal with IBM, which led to the leak of theprivate data about every vehicle in thecountry, including those used by bothpolice and military. All the sensitiveinformation about the Swedish Citizens,including fighter pilots of Swedish airforce, members of the military&#39;s mostsecretive units, police suspects, peopleunder the witness relocation programme,the weight capacity of all roads andbridges, and much more. Reason behindthe same was that the transport agencyuploaded IBM’s entire database with all the sensitive information onto the cloudservers and then emailed the entiredatabase in messages to marketers thatsubscribe to it. This outsourcing deal gaveIBM staff outsideSweden access to the
Swedish transport agency&#39;s systemswithout undergoing proper securityclearance checks. Although the data breach happened in 2015, Swedish Secret Service
discovered it in 2016.
